##### ABSTRACT
With the rise of mobile technology, the personal lives and sensitive information of
everyday citizens are carried about without a thought to the risks involved. Despite this
high possibility of harm, many fail to use simple security to protect themselves because
they feel the benefits of securing their devices do not outweigh the cost to usability. The
main issue is that beyond initial authentication, sessions are maintained using optional
timeout mechanisms where a session will end if a user is inactive for a period of time.
This interruption-based form of continuous authentication requires constant user
intervention leading to frustration, which discourages its use. No solution currently exists
that provides an implementation beyond the insecure and low usability of simple timeout
and re-authentication. This work identifies the flaws of current mobile authentication
techniques and provides a new solution that is not limiting to the user, has a system for
secure, active continuous authentication, and increases the usability and security over
current methods.
